AI-Powered Portfolio Assistant
About the Project
This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase the intersection of modern web development and intelligent AI integration. Rather than a static display of work, I engineered this platform to act as an interactive experience for recruiters and clients.

I focused on building a "Human-in-the-loop" AI system, where a custom-trained assistant can answer questions about my technical stack, project history, and availability in real-time.

Core Features
Interactive AI Assistant: A custom-integrated chatbot trained on my professional background to provide instant responses to visitor queries.

Dynamic Project Showcase: A deep dive into my work, including tools like PRODUCT-EXPLAINER-PRO and AI Shoppers Muse.

Performance Optimized: Built with a focus on speed, accessibility, and high conversion for business inquiries.

Responsive Design: A seamless "glassmorphism" UI that works perfectly across all device sizes.

Technical Stack
This project demonstrates my proficiency with:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

AI Implementation: Integration with LLM APIs for the portfolio assistant

Deployment: Vercel with automated CI/CD pipelines
